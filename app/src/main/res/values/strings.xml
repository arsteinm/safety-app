    <string name="welcome2_item1">Our goal is to help you gather data about your school climate through observation and social interaction.</string>
    <string name="welcome2_item2">This tool can then be used to create an action plan focusing on locations and/or indicators.</string>
    <string name="welcome3_title">General Instructions</string>
    <string name="welcome3_item1">1. Once you\'ve created a new survey, you can scroll through and select from a list of locations where observations will be conducted.</string>
    <string name="welcome3_item2">2. Once you\'ve chosen a location, rank and prioritize each environmental indicator or observed behaviors.</string>
    <string name="welcome3_item3">3. Use the Action Plan space to note possible actions to resolve specific issues.</string>
    <string name="welcome3_item4">4. It is best to conduct the observations when students and staff are using the space as they normally would.</string>
    <string name="welcome3_item5">5. Ideally, the walk-through will be completed in one day by the same person or persons. If this is not possible, try and complete the walk-
through during one week.</string>
